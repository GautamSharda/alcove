# Generating a self-signed Certificate for Testing

When you do not have access to a valid X.509 OpenSSL Certificate, in order to
run the NodeJS server, you need to generate a self-signed Certificate since it
requires HTTPS communication. 

Use the following two commands to create an ECDSA key and self-signed cert.

```
openssl ecparam -out ssl.key -name secp521r1 -genkey
openssl req -x509 -new -key ssl.key -out ssl.crt -days 365 -subj "/C=US/ST=Iowa/L=Coralville/O=Bio::Neos, Inc./CN=localhost"
```

Trouble? Try RSA instead:
```
openssl genrsa -out ssl.key 2048
```
